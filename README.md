## 📜 Historical Context

India's language policy is one of the most complex in the world:
- **22 official languages** in the Eighth Schedule
- **1,652 mother tongues** recorded in the census
- **No national language** — only "official" languages
- A diversity index of **0.914** (two random Indians speak different languages 91.4% of the time)

The conflict over Hindi imposition has shaped Indian politics for nearly a century, particularly in Tamil Nadu where anti-Hindi movements have dominated politics since 1967.
