        <!-- The Stakes -->
        <section class="article-section">
            <p class="dropcap">When the Indian Constitution was adopted in 1950, its framers punted on one of the most divisive questions facing the new nation: What should be its official language? They chose a compromise — Hindi in the Devanagari script would be the official language, but English would continue for 15 years. That 15-year deadline has now stretched to 76 years and counting.</p>
            
            <p>India is home to <strong>1,652 mother tongues</strong> according to the census, with 22 languages officially recognized in the Constitution's Eighth Schedule. The linguistic diversity is staggering — India's diversity index of 0.914 means that two randomly selected Indians will speak different native languages 91.4% of the time.</p>

            <p>This isn't just a bureaucratic curiosity. Language in India is intertwined with regional identity, political power, and economic opportunity. The question of which language gets official status is a question of which communities get access to government jobs, education, and political representation.</p>

        <!-- The North-South Divide -->
        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>The Great Linguistic Divide</h2>
            <p>The map of India's languages tells the story of a fundamental cultural split. The northern "Hindi Belt" — comprising states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh — uses languages from the Indo-Aryan family, closely related to Hindi. The southern states speak entirely different Dravidian languages: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't just a linguistic difference. Dravidian languages are part of a distinct language family with no relation to Hindi whatsoever. A Tamil speaker learning Hindi faces the same challenge as an English speaker learning Mandarin — completely different vocabulary, grammar, and script.</p>

            <h2>The Three-Language Formula: A Policy Without Consensus</h2>
            <p>Since 1968, India has officially followed a "three-language formula" for education: students should learn their mother tongue, Hindi, and English. In theory, this promotes linguistic harmony. In practice, it's a asymmetric burden.</p>

            <h2>What Could a Solution Look Like?</h2>
            <p>Several alternatives have been proposed over the decades:</p>
            
            <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>Symmetric Three-Language Formula:</strong> Hindi Belt states must learn a southern language, just as the south is expected to learn Hindi. Currently, only Karnataka has experimented with teaching Tamil/Telugu as third language options.</li>
                <li><strong>All Languages Official:</strong> APJ Abdul Kalam proposed making all 22 scheduled languages official languages of India, not just Hindi. This remains the DMK's stated goal.</li>
                <li><strong>English as Neutral Link:</strong> Continue English as the inter-state communication language — a "colonial hangover" that ironically provides a level playing field since it's equally foreign to all.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> As AI translation improves, the practical need for a single link language diminishes. Government services could theoretically operate in all 22 scheduled languages.</li>

        <!-- Final Thoughts -->
        <section class="article-section conclusion">
            <h2>The Unfinished Story</h2>
            <p>India's language policy remains what it was in 1950: an unstable compromise held together by political expediency rather than consensus. The Constitution's "15 years" of English has become indefinite bilingualism. Hindi continues to grow — but so does resistance to its imposition.</p>
            
            <p>The 1965 agitation showed that linguistic identity in India runs deep enough to die for. The 2019 and 2022 flare-ups showed the issue hasn't cooled. As long as language remains tied to power, opportunity, and identity, India's language wars will continue — fought in Parliament, in streets, and in the quiet choices of what language to teach one's children.</p>

            <p>The story of India's linguistic democracy is ultimately a story about what kind of nation India wants to be: a federation of distinct peoples united by a common framework, or a homogenized nation-state with a single dominant identity. Seventy-six years in, the answer remains contested.</p>
