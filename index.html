            <h3>⚡ The Conflict in 30 Seconds</h3>
            <p>India has 22 official languages, but Hindi speakers want it to be THE national language. Southern states—especially Tamil Nadu—have fought this for 90 years. <strong>People have died.</strong> It's still not resolved.</p>

        <section class="article-section">
            <p class="dropcap">In 1965, students set themselves on fire over a language exam. In 2022, #HindiTeriyaadhPoda ("Don't know Hindi, get lost") trended nationwide. The fight over which language Indians should speak has never ended—and people have died for it.</p>
            
            <p>India has <strong>1,652 mother tongues</strong> and 22 official languages. Two random Indians speak different native languages 91% of the time.<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup> When the Constitution was written in 1950, its framers punted on the question—making Hindi official, but keeping English for "15 years." That deadline stretched to 76 years and counting.</p>

            <p>This isn't bureaucracy. Language determines who gets government jobs, university admissions, and political power.</p>

        <!-- The North-South Divide -->
        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>The Great Linguistic Divide</h2>
            <p>A Tamil speaker learning Hindi faces the same challenge as an English speaker learning Mandarin—completely different vocabulary, grammar, and script. Dravidian languages have <strong>no relation to Hindi whatsoever.</strong><sup><a href="#sources">[2]</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <!-- Hindi Belt Isn't Monolithic -->
        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>The "Hindi Belt" Myth: 57 Languages Hidden in Plain Sight</h2>
            <p>The very term "Hindi speakers" obscures a crucial truth: the Census of India groups <strong>57 distinct mother tongues</strong> under the Hindi umbrella. Bhojpuri alone has 50 million speakers — more than Polish or Ukrainian. Rajasthani (18 million), Chhattisgarhi (18 million), Maithili (12 million), and Marwari (7 million) are each substantial languages by global standards.<sup><a href="#sources">[1]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>This grouping inflates Hindi's apparent dominance. When politicians cite "44% speak Hindi," they're counting a Bhojpuri-speaking farmer in Bihar and a Marwari trader in Jodhpur as "Hindi speakers" — even though these individuals might struggle to understand each other in their native tongues.</p>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <h4>📊 The Census Grouping Effect</h4>
                <p>If Bhojpuri, Rajasthani, Chhattisgarhi, and Maithili were counted separately (as linguists argue they should be), Hindi's native speaker share would drop from <strong>43.6% to roughly 26%</strong> — changing the entire political calculus.</p>
            </div>

            <p>For speakers of these "grouped" languages, the Hindi imposition debate hits differently. A Maithili speaker in Bihar might resent both Southern resistance to Hindi <em>and</em> the erasure of their own language in official "Hindi" statistics. They're caught between — their language subsumed into Hindi for political purposes, while they're told they're the beneficiaries of Hindi dominance.</p>

        <!-- Urdu & Hindu-Muslim Dimension -->
        <section class="article-section">
            <h2>The Ghost at the Feast: Urdu's Contested Place</h2>
            <p>No discussion of India's language politics is complete without confronting its most politically charged linguistic fault line: Hindi-Urdu. These are, linguistically speaking, the <em>same language</em> — mutually intelligible in everyday speech. Yet they carry such different political weight that mentioning Urdu in Hindi Belt discourse can end conversations.<sup><a href="#sources">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>The split is a wound from 1947. During Partition, Urdu became Pakistan's national language — forever associating it with Muslim identity in the Hindu nationalist imagination. In India, Urdu retreated to a co-official status in a handful of states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Jharkhand), but its visibility in public life has steadily declined.</p>

            <div class="comparison-table">
                <div class="comparison-col">
                    <h3>The Linguistic Reality</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hindi and Urdu share 80-90% vocabulary in daily conversation</li>
                        <li>Same grammar, same pronunciation, same speech patterns</li>
                        <li>Difference is primarily in script (Devanagari vs. Nastaliq) and literary/formal register</li>
                        <li>Linguists often call them "Hindustani" — one language, two standards</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="comparison-col">
                    <h3>The Political Reality</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Urdu is often framed as "Muslim language," Hindi as "Hindu language"</li>
                        <li>RSS/BJP position: Promote "Shuddh Hindi" (pure Hindi) with Sanskrit vocabulary</li>
                        <li>Secular parties defend Urdu as part of syncretic Ganga-Jamuni culture</li>
                        <li>Urdu-medium schools declining; community reports marginalization</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>For India's 200+ million Muslims, language politics carries an additional sting. Promotion of "Hindi" often means specifically promoting a Sanskritized version that erases the Persian-Arabic vocabulary common in everyday Hindustani. The debate over Hindi isn't just North vs. South — it's also a proxy for questions about secularism, Muslim identity, and what "Indian culture" means.</p>

            <p>For Dalit activists and scholars, the language debate looks different than it does for upper-caste elites on either side:</p>

            <div class="perspective-box">
                <h4>The Dalit Perspective on Language</h4>
                <p><strong>On Hindi:</strong> "Hindi was never 'our' language. It was the language of Brahminical texts, Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, the upper-caste literary tradition. When they say 'our mother tongue,' whose mother are they talking about?"</p>
                <p><strong>On English:</strong> "English is a liberation language. It has no caste. Nobody can tell from your English accent which village your grandfather cleaned latrines in. That's why they want to keep it elite — if everyone learned it, it wouldn't mark privilege anymore."</p>
                <p><strong>On Regional Languages:</strong> "Regional elites pushing Tamil or Telugu aren't fighting for us either. Brahminical dominance exists in every language. The question is access — who gets to learn what."</p>
                <p class="attribution">— Paraphrased from writings of Chandra Bhan Prasad, Kancha Ilaiah, and other Dalit intellectuals</p>
            </div>

            <p>The brutal arithmetic: Children from English-medium private schools dominate competitive exams, elite university admissions, and corporate hiring. Children from Hindi-medium or regional-language government schools face a glass ceiling that language creates. The debate over which language to impose often ignores that <em>any</em> single-language policy will disadvantage the poor.</p>

        <!-- Final Thoughts -->
        <section class="article-section conclusion">
            <h2>The Unfinished Story</h2>
            <p>India's language policy remains what it was in 1950: an unstable compromise held together by political expediency rather than consensus. The Constitution's "15 years" of English has become indefinite bilingualism. Hindi continues to grow — but so does resistance to its imposition.</p>
            
            <p>The 1965 agitation showed that linguistic identity in India runs deep enough to die for. The 2019 and 2022 flare-ups showed the issue hasn't cooled. As long as language remains tied to power, opportunity, and identity, India's language wars will continue — fought in Parliament, in streets, and in the quiet choices of what language to teach one's children.</p>

            <p>The story of India's linguistic democracy is ultimately a story about what kind of nation India wants to be: a federation of distinct peoples united by a common framework, or a homogenized nation-state with a single dominant identity. Seventy-six years in, the answer remains contested.</p>
